# Create Pull Request

Gather information about the current branch and create a well-formatted Pull Request using the GitHub CLI.

## Steps

1. **Review Changes:**
   Review the git log and diff to understand what was changed since `origin/main`. This will help inform the PR title and description.
   ```bash
   git log origin/main..HEAD --stat
   git diff origin/main..HEAD
   ```

2. **Determine PR Title:**
   Use the Conventional Commits format for the PR title:
   - `feat(...)`: A new feature
   - `fix(...)`: A bug fix
   - `test(...)`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
   - `chore(...)`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files (e.g., updating dependencies or `.agent` files)
   - `refactor(...)`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

   *Example: `feat(recipes): Add recipe import from Markdown`*

3. **Determine PR Body:**
   Create a comprehensive PR body covering:
   - **Overview:** Why is this PR necessary? What problem does it solve?
   - **Changes:** Bullet points detailing the specific technical changes made.
   - **Verification:** How was this tested? (e.g., CI, local tests, manual verification).

4. **Create the PR:**
   Use the `gh pr create` command to push the branch (if not already pushed) and open the PR.

   Write the PR body to `.tmp/pr-body.txt` using the Write tool, then:
   ```bash
   # Make sure the branch is pushed to origin first
   git push -u origin HEAD

   # Create the pull request (use --body-file to avoid heredoc issues)
   gh pr create --title "<type>(<scope>): <subject>" --body-file .tmp/pr-body.txt
   ```

## Notes

- Before creating a PR, always ensure tests and linters have been run locally if applicable.
- If the PR is a `chore` for dumping context, refer to the `/dump-context` workflow for specific PR body requirements and automatically merge it when CI passes.
- Always use `--body-file` instead of inline `--body` with heredocs to avoid permission issues.
